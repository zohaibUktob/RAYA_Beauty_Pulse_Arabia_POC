Tatouche, the largest beauty platform in Saudi Arabia, is located in Riyadh on Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq Street. We’re excited to announce the opening of our new store at Nakheel Mall for one month, and we would love for you to visit, explore our beauty products, and try them out.

This November, we’re celebrating with the ‘Your Beauty with Tatouche’ Festival! Enjoy discounts of up to 40% on all our products, plus a free gift with every purchase. You’ll also receive a 200 SAR voucher upon order receipt and a chance to win a Jovs IPL Hair Removal & Skincare Device valued at over 1500 SAR. Sounds good?

Today, our special beauty offer is on the #1 best-selling device worldwide! We all know how frustrating traditional hair removal methods like waxing and shaving can be, right? Now, the perfect solution is in your hands! We have an exclusive offer on the SmoothSkin Pure Fit IPL Device, a British-made device using Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) technology that guarantees effective, long-lasting hair removal from all areas of your body and face—without any extra cost or hassle.

This device works by focusing a beam of light on the hair follicles, heating them and effectively preventing regrowth thanks to IPL technology. It has a comfortable, ergonomic design that fits perfectly in your hand, making it easy to use and store. With its precise head, you can safely remove hair from sensitive areas like the bikini line and underarms with high precision. The device delivers 20 watts of power and 130 flashes per minute, allowing you to treat all areas of your body in under 10 minutes. Sounds good, right?

It also features a built-in sensor that detects your skin tone and adjusts the intensity for safe, effective results. With 3 operating levels, you can achieve professional-grade results from the comfort of your home. Plus, it offers unlimited flashes—imagine a device that lasts a lifetime! It also includes a UV filter to protect your skin and eyes. And of course, we all know that each area of our body and skin requires a different level of intensity, right? This device has a built-in sensor that releases the right number of flashes and power according to your skin’s sensitivity, ensuring a safe and effective experience.

This fast and efficient device is so easy to use, and the results will start showing by week 3. Sounds amazing, right? How many times have you considered starting laser sessions but hesitated due to the high cost and the long time it takes since each hair removal session typically costs around 400 SAR, and you’d need at least 10 sessions to achieve the desired results, totaling 4000 SAR! With the SmoothSkin IPL Device, you can say goodbye to those costs. Look at how much money, time, and effort you’re saving!

Since we have complete confidence in our products, with the Golden Guarantee, you can get your money back within 60 days if you don’t achieve the desired results. The original price of the device before the offer was 1300 SAR, but in celebration of the Beauty Festival, our offer is unbeatable. Today, it’s available for only 1149 SAR, and to make it affordable for everyone, we’ve also made it available for 4 easy installments through Tabby at 287.25 SAR per month.

But that’s not all! Anyone who contacts us to place an order via WhatsApp will receive a valuable free gift just by sending my name ‘RAYA’ to the WhatsApp number where I’ve sent you the product catalog. Alright? We look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your time, and have a great day!”
